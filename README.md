The Hangman Game 🎮 is a fun word-guessing challenge where players try to guess a hidden word letter by letter. The game keeps track of incorrect guesses, and for every wrong letter, a part of the "hangman" is drawn 🪢. Players win by guessing the word correctly before the drawing is completed!

In this project, users can input letters 🅰️ and receive feedback whether the letter is correct ✅ or incorrect ❌. If too many wrong guesses are made, the game ends with the player losing 😓. The interface is simple yet engaging, making it a great way to practice vocabulary and improve spelling 📝. The project can be expanded to include multiple difficulty levels 📊, hints 💡, and different word categories 🔤.

This fun, interactive game combines both logic and vocabulary, offering players an enjoyable way to test their word-guessing skills 🤓!
